2.1 SOURCE
The data I used was the Data Collision information for the city of Seattle, from 2004-2020. This data is pulled from the police reports of the incidents, and has many variables,
such as the weather, location, how the car hit something, and if people such as pedestrians or cyclists were involved. The target label, severity, is split into two results “1”
for property-only collisions and “2” for collisions with injuries. While the dataset is large, it is clear from the outset that many columns can be dropped. Columns like
“INATTENTIONIND” and “EXCEPTRSNCODE” are full of null values. Columns like “STATUS” and “REPORTNO” are filled, but irrelevant to the severity of the crash.
