1.2 PROBLEM
People do not enjoy car accidents. In minor cases, the car is usually damaged, and possibly there is property damage. In the worst cases, people can be injured and killed in a
severe crash. The factors that go into the severity of a crash are numerous. Road conditions, lighting, weather, all play a part. So, this project will look to see if we can use
data to predict what conditions lead to the most severe crashes. 

We can use data this data in a multitude of ways. In a small way, this could be used in driving courses, emphasizing to new drivers what conditions to be most careful of. We could
use this in cars and map applications in order to warn drivers of conditions and to slow down. This could also possibly be used in self-driving cars as a way to reduce accidents.
